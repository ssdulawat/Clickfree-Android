    <string name="frequent_question_first_title">The most important ingredient for a successful backup: time! If you’ve got thousands upon thousands of photos and videos, a complete backup will take several hours to complete.</string>
    <string name="frequent_question_second_title">ClickFree can’t do anything without your permission.</string>
    <string name="frequent_question_third_title">Using ClickFree with Android is easy, but a few Android devices won’t work.(iPhone and iPad users can ignore this one.)</string>
    <string name="frequent_question_first_description">Most phones store only a few images on the device and the majority in the cloud. ClickFree needs to make sure it downloads and saves every single one of those precious memories. We recommend having a full battery and setting aside several hours for your first backup. However, if you don’t have the time for that, don’t worry! The great thing about ClickFree is that it starts every backup where it left off. So you can stop a backup by hitting “cancel,” and the next time you start a backup, it will only have to save the remaining pictures. After you have completed a full backup, subsequent backups will take only a few minutes to complete. It’s your choice! Either set aside several hours for a first backup, or do it in stages when you have time. Either way, your pictures will be saved!</string>
    <string name="frequent_question_second_description">When you first launch and use the ClickFree app, you will be asked for several different permissions. It will ask for your permission to access your photos and contacts when you attempt to back them up. If you attempt to take pictures or videos with the “use camera” feature, it will ask for permission to access your camera and microphone. You must tap “OK” or “Allow” to all permissions for ClickFree to work. If you tap “Don’t Allow,” ClickFree will do nothing. This is important: granting permission will NOT give Datalogixx or any company access to your device, your information or your photos. But ClickFree can’t save your photos, videos and contacts if you don’t give it permission to access them. Makes sense when you think about it that way! If you hit “deny” for any of these permissions, you can fix the problem by going to your device’s settings. For iPhone and iPad the steps are as follows: Go to settings Scroll down to find ClickFree and tap it. (you will find it listed alphabetically among your apps). For each setting shown below, move the slider switch to the right, which is the green position as shown. Now your ClickFree can get to work!</string>
    <string name="frequent_question_third_description">Android devices can only talk to devices like ClickFree if they are equipped with a feature called “OTG.” This is an issue with Android and unfortunately one we can’t do anything to change! The overwhelming majority of Android devices today support OTG. But some don’t. Many pay-as-you go phones and some Chinese brands of Android phone do not support OTG. Sometimes company-issued phones that you get from work will not support OTG. As a general rule, Samsung phones from the past several years will work, provided they are not pay-as-you-go or issued to you from work. The best way to determine whether your Android device supports OTG is to search for the specific make and model of your phone online or contact the manufacturer. If you have ever used an external drive with your device before, your device definitely supports OTG. Another method that may work is to download an “OTG checker” app like this one. It may be able to tell you if your device supports OTG. This app is free to download and use. This does NOT apply to Apple devices. Apple devices will work as long as they are up to date with the latest iOS.</string>
